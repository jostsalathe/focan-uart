# Adapter board for using the original Focan GZ3 Display for controlling a VESC6 motor controller

This project uses the UART interface of the VESC6 to translate the commands from the display unit to control and config commands for the VESC6 and extract motor status data from it to report sensible data back to the display unit.

The adapter also has to incorporate power distribution to the vehicle lighting as well as evaluation circuitry and logic for the break lever switches to cut power when breaks are applied (maybe even gradually apply regen?).
